# ANN-Regression-EnergyOutputPrediction
This is an ANN regression model to predict a Combined Cycle Power Plant's Energy Output given variables like Temperature, Humidity, Vacuum, and Pressure, Streamlit App included.

## R2 Score: 89% | LOSS (MSE) : 26.62

This model was created based on a dataset taken from UCI datasets website, which was about a Combined Cycle Power Plant and its Energy Output. In case the streamlit app doesn't work well, please refer to the predictive model in the .ipynb file.

This app would require local installation (at terminal) of streamlit, python, keras, tensorflow, scikit-learn, joblib and other libraries to function.

Many thanks,
Rachana
